::: {#hero-heading}

:::

I am a PhD candidate at the [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/), where I am researching **project management** and **agile** methodologies. Specifically, I am interested in the **leadership skills** that enable agile project managers to contribute to project success, and how agile can be defined through the lens of **paradox theory**. 

In addition to my research, I have been lecturing on project management in executive education programs at [Nova SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/) since 2012, where I am alse involved in the challenging school's digital transformation process. 

I am passionate about **R** and **R development**, and I specialize in developing leadership skills assessment tools and personalized reporting using R and RMarkdown.


My **interests** are: 

* Project management, both predictive and agile methodologies
* Survey based quantitative empirical research
* Reproducible automatic data-analysis and reporting with R


Outside of work, my time is mostly occupied by my three wonderful children, who keep me on my toes and bring joy to my life. I love spending time outdoors, and during the summer you can often find me at the beach, enjoying the sun, sea, and a good book. I am fluent in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish, and I've been trying to learn Hebrew for the past few years, although progress has been slow.
