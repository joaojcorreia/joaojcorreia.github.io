Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is João Granja-Correia and I am a **PhD candidate** at [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/), where my research focuses on **project management** and its connection to **project success**, with a particular interest in understanding the impact of end-user bricolage initiatives on **project success**.

In addition to my research, I have been lecturing on project management at [Nova SBE](www.novasbe.unl.pt) since 2012.

I am also passionate about **R and R development**, and I specialize in developing leadership skills assessment tools and personalized reporting using R and RMarkdown.

I also contribute as a moderator for [SocArXiv](https://socopen.org/), supporting academic collaboration and open science.
