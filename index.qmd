::: {#hero-heading}
Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is João Granja-Correia and I am a **PhD candidate** at the [Universidad de Cantabria](web.unican.es), where I am researching **project management** and **agile methodologies**. Specifically, I am interested in the leadership skills that enable agile project managers to contribute to project success, and how agile itself can be defined through the lens of **paradox theory**.

In addition to my research, I have been lecturing on project management at [Nova SBE](www.novasbe.unl.pt) since 2012.

I am also passionate about **R and R development**, and I specialize in developing leadership skills assessment tools and personalized reporting using R and RMarkdown.
