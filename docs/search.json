    "text": "To some extent, I am a creature of habit. Every year, I take my summer holidays in early September on the same island, Porto Santo.\n\n\n\nView of the Porto Santo beach\n\n\nPorto Santo is a small island with a resident population of around 5,000 and limited economic activity, primarily relying on summer tourism. The island’s landscape is arid, having had its native Dracaena vegetation destroyed and soils degraded due to over-farming of wheat in the 16th century. Porto Santo faces what locals call ‘double insularity’ as it’s part of the Madeira archipelago, which is itself isolated from the mainland. It depends on daily connections via sea with Madeira for most of its produce and goods.\n\n\n\nRainbow over the sea\n\n\nI first went to Porto Santo on a scuba trip in 2010. I had long heard about the spectacular dive spots of Porto Santo, with it’s pristine clear blue waters of tepid temperatures. At the time I was diving frequently, so Porto Santo was a must go place. I knew Porto Santo was a small island in the Madeira archipelago, but at the time I had never even been to Madeira itself.\n\n\n\nView of Ponta da Calheta with Ilheu da Cal\n\n\nMy first experience was great, not only the scuba diving was simply spectacular, but also the island had what for me is the most beautiful beach in Portugal. Life there was peaceful, with not much to do. I remember that during that first stay I was able to read a couple of Ian M. Banks books from the Culture series.\nSince that initial trip, we’ve spent the entire year looking forward to my future summer holidays in Porto Santo, and we’ve visited almost every year, a total of twelve times. I aspire to one day retire on Porto Santo, relishing long beach walks and peaceful reading by the sea.”\nThis year was no different. Although we were greeted by heavy rain as we were leaving the airplane, which is a rare occurrence in Porto Santo, we had wonderful weather during our stay. We were able to enjoy the beach and the sun. However, with three kids, you don’t get a lot of time to sit and enjoy a book. Still, I managed to finish a couple of books and made significant progress in another one. All three are interesting books, and I’ll be writing about them here soon.\n\n\n\nEarly evening view of Porto Santo beach from Vila Baleira\n\n\nNow, back home, resuming work, and with the kids back at school, I’ve already started dreaming about my next trip to Porto Santo, which is likely to be in September 2024. It’s a love for the island that I’ve passed on to my kids; the youngest has already asked when we’re going back to Porto Santo.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {On My Favorite Place on Earth},\n  date = {2023-10-12},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20231012_My_favorite_place_on_earth},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “On My Favorite Place on\nEarth.” October 12, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20231012_My_favorite_place_on_earth."

    "title": "A Review of ‘L’utilità dell’inutile: Manifesto’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The final book that I managed to read during my short August break was “L’utilità dell’inutile: Manifesto Personale” by Nuccio Ordine (“The Usefulness of the Useless”). Nuccio Ordine was an Italian philosopher and thinker that sadly passed away last June. I was meaning to read something of his for some time now, and “The Usefulness of the Useless” seemed like a good place to start. I had bought the book a couple of months back, so I made sure this was one of the books I brought with me on my break, and I was not disappointed.\n\n\n\nL’utilità dell’Inutile\n\n\nIn many ways, this book can be regarded as a personal manifesto countering several modern-world excesses, particularly the relentless emphasis on the need for efficiency and utility.\nIn the first part of the book, Nuccio, a classicist and literature professor, eloquently champions the importance of reading the classics. He highlights the incredible font of knowledge that lies within these seemingly ‘useless’ classics. Nuccio’s profound appreciation for these timeless works serves as a compelling reminder of their potential to enrich our lives. Through the pages of these ‘useless’ classics, we gain profound insights into human nature, culture, and the complexities of our world. Nuccio emphasizes that these literary treasures offer not only wisdom but also inspiration and unique perspectives that continue to shape our understanding of the human experience.\nThis message resonates deeply with me. A few years ago, during a similar summer break, I immersed myself in both the Iliad and the Odyssey. These ancient epics are not only fascinating pieces of literature but also a gateway to connecting with the distant past and its characters. Although these works are steeped in mythology, they masterfully portray the timeless flaws and strengths of humanity. I later purchased and read abridged versions of both works to my children, hoping to instill in them a taste and appreciation for the classical world.\nIn the second part of the book, Nuccio, who was also an educator and professor, shifts his focus to education, particularly at the university level. He argues against two trends: the treatment of students as customers and the declining interest in social sciences and liberal arts. Nuccio contends that the role of a university extends beyond producing workers with specialized skills tailored to current market demands. Instead, he asserts that universities should nurture minds and thinkers capable of engaging with the world in more profound ways.\nI find myself in agreement with both of his assessments. Working in a highly market-oriented university, I have witnessed firsthand the issues arising from treating students as mere customers. This approach often leads to students focusing solely on grades rather than genuine learning and skill development. Simultaneously, professors are pressured to prioritize entertaining classes over the delivery of knowledge and skill-building.\nMy own career path has been far from straightforward, and I can relate to the concept of the usefulness of the useless. Learning to program in R, for example, was one of these seemingly inefficient, time-consuming endeavors. I initially encountered R during my master’s thesis, where I used it to create graphs. Afterward, I rarely touched it until a few years ago, when I decided, of my own volition, to enroll in an R course on Coursera. Despite the course’s somewhat haphazard structure, I persevered and completed all five modules. At the time, this quest seemed profoundly useless. However, the skills I acquired have proven immensely valuable, assisting me in numerous work and personal projects, including my current research. Even this very blog is constructed using R. Challenging myself to develop and address tasks in R has become a source of immense satisfaction.\nThis is just one example of the many seemingly useless skills and knowledge I’ve accumulated over time, which have, at various points, proved invaluable. I firmly believe that in our journey of personal growth, both useful and seemingly useless knowledge play crucial roles.\nNuccio Ordine was undoubtedly a great thinker of our time, and his passing is a significant loss. I haven’t ordered the next book in line yet, but I have my eye on his work “La cabala dell’asino: Asinità e conoscenza in Giordano Bruno” (Giordano Bruno and the Philosophy of the Ass by Nuccio Ordine). Giordano Bruno, a prominent medieval philosopher who met a tragic end at the hands of the Catholic Church, was one of Nuccio Ordine’s areas of expertise. I eagerly anticipate delving into this work as well.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {A {Review} of “{L’utilità} Dell’inutile: {Manifesto}”},\n  date = {2023-09-07},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230907_L’utilià_dell’inutile},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “A Review of ‘L’utilità\nDell’inutile: Manifesto’.” September 7, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230907_L’utilià_dell’inutile."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As a project management researcher and a PhD candidate, I am always looking for new ways to understand the challenges and frustrations that project managers face in their daily work. One of the sources that I find fascinating and insightful is the internet memes that project managers create and share online. Memes are humorous images or videos that often reflect the cultural and social aspects of a group or a situation. They can also reveal the emotions and attitudes of the people who create or consume them.\nIn this blog post, I want to share some of the project management memes that I have collected over time and analyze what they tell us about the common problems and pain points that project managers encounter. Some of the recurring themes that I have noticed are: lack of prioritization, unrealistic expectations from management, insufficient resources and sprint plans gone wrong. Here are some examples of these memes:\n\n\n\nLack of prioritization\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealistic expectations from management\n\n\n\n\n\nInsufficient resources\n\n\n\n\n\nSprint planning gone wrong\n\n\nThese memes show how project managers use humour to cope with the stress and frustration that they experience in their work. My goal is to eventually build a comprehensive database of project management memes and use them as a data source for my research. I hope that by doing so, I can contribute to the advancement of project management knowledge and practice.\nDo you have any funny PM memes? email them to me.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Collecting Project Management Memes},\n  date = {2023-05-25},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230525_PM_memes},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Collecting Project Management\nMemes.” May 25, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230525_PM_memes."

    "title": "Tuber - connecting R to Youtube API",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my first post related to R. Currently, I am working on a project focused on analyzing the comments from a series of videos featuring “SúperBigote” from the Venezuelan National TV’s, on a parritular YouTube channel (at a later date I will delve on the nature and origin of this channel).\nSince these videos can be classified as political propaganda, my objective is to conduct sentiment analysis and explore the words and expressions associated with each video. To begin this analysis, my initial step would involve scraping all the comments and associated data, such as likes and comments on comments, for further examination.\nAfter some search online I found out the “tuber” package. The R package “tuber” is a powerful tool for accessing and analyzing YouTube data directly within the R programming environment. Developed to simplify the process of extracting information from YouTube’s extensive collection of videos, channels, and playlists, tuber provides a comprehensive set of functions and features. With tuber, users can effortlessly retrieve video metadata, including title, description, view count, and upload date, as well as gather detailed statistics on channels and playlists. Additionally, tuber offers functionalities for searching videos, accessing comments, and even downloading video content. Its intuitive and user-friendly design makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced data scientists, making it an essential package for anyone interested in leveraging YouTube data for research, analysis, or content creation purposes.\nDue to the necessity of integrating with the YouTube API and the challenges I faced in finding up-to-date, comprehensive instructions online, I have decided to create this post. In doing so, I aim to provide a step-by-step guide that addresses the difficulties I encountered, ensuring a smoother integration process for others who may be facing similar obstacles.\nSo the first step is installing the tuber package and loading the library:\n\ninstall.packages('tuber')\nlibrary(tuber)\n\nNext you will need to go the Google APIs dashboard and create a new project. I already had my Google APIs account active from a previous project, so there might be an extra step here if you haven’t one already.\n\nThen, enable APIs and Services. -&gt; search for YouTube Data API v3 and enable that one.\n\nNext, create credentials. -&gt; You need to choose OAuth Client ID.\n\nFor that you will need to first setup the consent screen. Afterwards create the OAuth Client ID. Here you need to chose the Web application.\n\n\nOnce the you done this, you have finished. Now you need to take note of the ClientID and the Secret, and to download the Json to your working directory.\n\nIn R you code should look like this:\n\nlibrary(tuber)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nid &lt;- '108XXXXXXXXX-myidAAAAAAAA.apps.googleusercontent.com'\nsecret &lt;- 'GOCSPX-wrMYSECRETXXXXXXXXXX'\nyt_oauth(id, secret, token = '')\n\nOnce you’ve run the yt_oauth() command, you will authenticate the application and R will download a “.httr-oauth” file, and then tuber you connected to youtube and you can use all its functions. Namely the get_all_comments() to download all comments. Which later you can place it in a data-frame, and do data wrangling as needed.\nFrom session to session you need to reauthenticate the application by running the yt_oauth(). If you already have the “.httr-oauth” file on your working directory, this wont work. So to get around this, I added this piece of code at the beginning of my script.\n\nif (file.exists('.httr-oauth')) {\n  file.remove('.httr-oauth')\n}\n\nThis post marks the beginning of a series where I will delve into the analysis process. A significant challenge I face is that the majority of comments are in Spanish, rendering standard sentiment analysis packages ineffective. Therefore, my next hurdle will involve exploring alternative solutions, such as finding a suitable sentiment analysis package or utilizing a machine learning model capable of classifying the vast number of comments. Alternatively, I might resort to manually classifying approximately 6000 comments. Regardless, this presents an intriguing challenge that I am prepared to tackle in the upcoming stages.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Tuber - Connecting {R} to {Youtube} {API}},\n  date = {2023-06-05},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230603_Tuber},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Tuber - Connecting R to Youtube\nAPI.” June 5, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230603_Tuber."

    "title": "Reflections on Bent Flyvbjerg’s ‘Making Social Science Matter’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the realm of social science inquiry, navigating the complexities of research can often feel like a daunting task. As someone pursuing a PhD in management with an engineering background, I have personally experienced the struggle of reconciling my hard-science approach with the intricacies of social phenomena. Bent Flyvbjerg has focused much of his research in the field of project management. This was my initial contact with his work, namely his very relevant “Top Ten Behavioral Biases in Project Management: An Overview”. However after devouring a few other articles of his I searched online for other publications. It was in this context that I stumbled upon Bent Flyvbjerg’s thought-provoking book, “Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How it Can Succeed Again.”.\nFlyvbjerg’s book struck a chord with me, as it directly addressed many of the internal struggles I have encountered when studying project management from a social science perspective. Coming from a hard-science background, I found myself grappling with the unique complexities inherent in social science research. Flyvbjerg’s insightful exploration shed light on these challenges and provided a fresh perspective.\nEarly on one aspect of the book that particularly captivated me was Flyvbjerg’s discussion of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. What made it even more intriguing was his clever analogy using the game of chess. As a parent, I have observed my seven-year-old son’s journey into the world of chess. While I possess a basic understanding of the rules and some theoretical openings knowledge, I have remained at the novice level, and after just a few months I started losing consistently to my son. Clearly he had developed context dependent knowledge, that he is unable to express beyond my own level. Flyvbjerg’s analysis shed light on the reasons behind this disparity, deepening my understanding of the complexities involved in mastering a skill.\nOne of the pivotal concepts that Flyvbjerg emphasizes is the distinction between phronesis, episteme, and téchne. Phronesis refers to practical wisdom and judgement, episteme relates to theoretical knowledge, and téchne denotes technical know-how. In the social sciences, context-dependent phronesis plays a crucial role. Flyvbjerg argues that understanding the social world requires more than just theoretical knowledge or technical skills; it necessitates the cultivation of practical wisdom in the given context. This resonated deeply with my own research journey, highlighting the significance of context in unraveling the complexities of the dynamics surrounding project management.\nFlyvbjerg’s exploration of reflexivity further enriched my understanding of the social sciences. Reflexivity calls for researchers to critically reflect on their own biases, values, and assumptions that may influence their inquiries. It serves as a vital tool for enhancing the rigor and validity of social science research. Flyvbjerg’s insights reinforced the importance of self-awareness and continuous introspection in my own work, allowing for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Through this book, I have gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors as a social science researcher, reminding me of the critical importance of context, practical wisdom, and self-reflection. I am looking forward to reading his more project management related book “How big things get done”.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Reflections on {Bent} {Flyvbjerg’s} “{Making} {Social}\n    {Science} {Matter}”},\n  date = {2023-06-21},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230621_Reading_Reflections},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Reflections on Bent Flyvbjerg’s\n‘Making Social Science Matter’.” June 21, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230621_Reading_Reflections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to Spain to attend classes at the Universidad de Cantabria in Santander. During my trip, I made sure to explore both Bilbao and Santander, and I’m thrilled to share my first blog post about the remarkable city of Bilbao, which I must say, it exceeded all expectations. From stunning architectural wonders to captivating museums, Bilbao offers a perfect blend of art, culture, and history.\n\n\n\nView from the Bilbao Museum\n\n\nBilbao is a captivating city that effortlessly combines modernity with a deep sense of cleanliness and orderliness. During my visit, I was astounded by the immaculate condition of the public spaces, which were meticulously maintained and adorned with beautiful flowering plants. It was refreshing to witness how everyone took great care in keeping the city clean, even those accompanied by their furry companions. The cityscape itself is a harmonious blend of charming pre-Civil War buildings and contemporary structures. The architectural design is well-planned, ensuring a seamless integration of old and new. The wide and spacious roads allow for smooth navigation, contributing to a sense of openness and accessibility.\n\n\n\nPublic gardens\n\n\nWhat struck me the most were the abundance of modern playgrounds scattered throughout the city, a testament to Bilbao’s dedication to creating a livable environment for its residents. Additionally, the availability of university-wide WiFi coverage was a pleasant surprise. It was remarkable to experience such widespread connectivity, enabling easy access to the internet for students and visitors alike.\n\n\n\nOld city - Casco viejo\n\n\nThe old city, known as “casco viejo,” is a charming and enchanting neighborhood that exudes historical allure. As I strolled through its narrow streets, I couldn’t help but be captivated by the well-preserved medieval buildings that lined the thoroughfares. The casco viejo is a bustling hub of commerce, with a myriad of shops catering to tourists and locals alike. It’s the perfect place to immerse yourself in the local culture and indulge in the renowned pintxos, the Basque Country’s version of tapas. The architectural beauty of the buildings, constructed from local stone, creates a mesmerizing interplay of light and colors in the vibrant squares.\nThe Ria, a river that gracefully winds through Bilbao, offers a picturesque setting for a leisurely stroll, allowing visitors to soak in the beauty of the city. As I wandered along its banks, I couldn’t help but appreciate the historical significance of the Ria in shaping Bilbao’s identity as a vital urban center. It served as a crucial and strategic waterway, contributing to the city’s growth and prominence over the years. The Ria is adorned with several noteworthy bridges that add to its charm. One of the highlights is the modern Zubizuri bridge, a pedestrian bridge with its distinctive white arch that gracefully spans the river, inviting pedestrians to cross with elegance. Another notable bridge is the Puente de La Salve, an architectural marvel that impressively connects both sides of the river.\n\n\n\nView if the Ría with the Guggenheim, Puente de La Salve and the Iberdrola tower\n\n\nMuseums to visit:\n\nFirst on the list is the Bilbao Museum, conveniently located near the iconic Iberdrola tower. This hidden gem houses a remarkable eclectic collection of art from the late 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The best part? Admission is free, making it an absolute must-visit.\nNo visit to Bilbao would be complete without a stop at the world-renowned Guggenheim Museum. Its distinctive architecture alone is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from far away. I highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance and arriving early. During my visit, I had the pleasure of exploring the Oskar Kokoschka exhibit. The visually impressive paintings were not only a feast for the eyes but also shed light on the tumultuous history of 20th-century Europe. The carefully curated exhibition allowed me to delve deeper into the artist’s journey and gain a profound understanding of the era in which he lived.\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the Bilbao Archeology Museum is an absolute must. Tucked away in the charming old city, this museum may go unnoticed by many. However, it holds a treasure trove of artifacts that shed light on Bilbao’s rich past. The stone age collection, in particular, showcases the importance of cave findings in the Bizkaia area. Through interactive displays, I embarked on a virtual journey to local caves, immersing myself in cave paintings. The museum’s antiquity and medieval collections further enhanced my understanding of Bilbao’s strategic significance throughout history.\n\nIn my next post, I will share my day trip to Portugalete. Situated just a short distance from Bilbao, this charming town offers a unique blend of historical landmarks and captivating coastal views.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Three Days Enjoying {Bilbao}},\n  date = {2023-06-26},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230626_Bilbao},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Three Days Enjoying Bilbao.”\nJune 26, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230626_Bilbao."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Following up on my previous adventures in Bilbao, I wanted to share the highlights of my day trip to Portugalete. On our last day in Bilbao, we decided to embark on a boat trip to explore this neighboring town. Opting for the El Bote Tours service turned out to be a fantastic choice as it provided us with an excellent experience from start to finish. I highly recommend this excursion to anyone visiting Bilbao!\n\n\n\nView from the Ria of the Bilbao museum, with children enjoying the summer day\n\n\nThe boat journey, lasting approximately an hour and a half, took us from the picturesque Bilbao ria all the way to the sea. As we gradually moved away from the bustling city, an intriguing transformation unfolded before our eyes. The remnants of Bilbao’s industrial past emerged on the horizon, with sprawling abandoned industrial spaces that served as a poignant reminder of the city’s history. However, what captured our attention was the sight of modern neighborhoods taking their place, breathing new life into the landscape. It was a fascinating contrast to witness the blend of Bilbao’s industrial heritage and the vibrant evolution of its urban fabric.\n\n\n\nModern residential buildings on the right bank, and old industrial building on the left bank\n\n\nAmidst the evolving landscape, Bilbao proudly preserves the occasional operating industrial buildings that stand as a testament to its rich industrial heritage. One remarkable example that encapsulates the city’s industrial prowess is the ArcelorMittal steel mill. Originally established as Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in the early 20th century, this steel production facility has been an integral part of Bilbao’s industrial development. Today, it continues to make a significant impact, providing employment opportunities for a large workforce and contributing to the local economy. The ArcelorMittal steel mill stands as a powerful reminder of Bilbao’s industrial legacy and the resilience of its industrial sector in the face of changing times.\n\n\n\nArcelorMittal steel mill\n\n\nThe boat tour concluded at the picturesque seaside village of Getxo, which added a touch of coastal charm to our Bilbao adventure. As we approached Getxo by sea, our gaze was captivated by the breathtaking Arriluce lighthouse, standing proudly as a welcoming beacon. Once a favored summer getaway for Bilbao’s affluent residents, Getxo still retains its elegant allure. The village is dotted with beautiful mansions, predominantly built in the early 20th century by the esteemed architect Manuel Maria Smith. These architectural gems, nestled among the village streets, offer a glimpse into a bygone era of opulence and refined aesthetics. Exploring Getxo is like stepping back in time, where the tranquility of the seaside blends harmoniously with the architectural splendor of these historic mansions.\n\n\n\nFaro de Arriluce\n\n\nBetween Getxo and Portugalete lies the magnificent Vizcaya Bridge, a remarkable engineering marvel that adds a touch of grandeur to the landscape. Built in 1893, this iconic iron construction stands as the world’s oldest transporter bridge. Designed by Alberto Palacio, a disciple of the renowned Gustave Eiffel, the bridge holds a special place in architectural history. During our visit, we had the pleasure of purchasing tickets and experiencing the thrill of moving across in the gondola. It was truly a unique and memorable journey. Adding to its prestige, the Vizcaya Bridge was rightfully recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on July 13, 2006. Still fully operational, the bridge spans 164 meters and operates every 8 minutes, seamlessly transporting both cars and passengers throughout the day.\n\n\n\nView of the Vyzcaya Bridge from Portugalete\n\n\nNestled by the tranquil Ria, Portugalete is a charming village that offers a serene cityscape. While wandering through its streets, we couldn’t help but admire two notable landmarks. The Estación de la Canilla, with its vibrant colors, stood gracefully by the water’s edge, enhancing the scenic beauty of the surroundings. The imposing Basílica de Santa María commanded attention with its historical significance and architectural splendor. As the day drew to a close, we found solace in the convenience of the modern subway connection, making our journey back to the city seamless.\n\n\n\nView of Portugalete with the Basílica de Santa María and the Estación de la Canilla\n\n\nComing up next on my blog, I’ll be sharing my experiences and adventures in the beautiful city of Santander.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Day Trip to {Portugalete}},\n  date = {2023-07-14},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230714_Bilbao},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Day Trip to Portugalete.” July\n14, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230714_Bilbao."

    "text": "This post is long overdue, marking the final chapter of my trip to northern Spain. During the last leg of my journey, I had the pleasure of staying in the beautiful city of Santander. My initial reason for coming to Spain was to attend in-person classes at the Universidad de Cantabria. I seized the opportunity to enroll in a three-day course on scientific publications, an area where I aimed to enhance my skills. The course, titled “Aspectos fundamentales de preparacion de publicaciones cientificas,” was highly informative and provided valuable insights into this crucial aspect of academia. Interacting with fellow colleagues and experiencing daily life on the Universidad de Cantabria campus along the “Avenida de los Castros” was both enlightening and fulfilling. I also took the time to express my gratitude to the staff at the “Escuela de Doctorado” for their unwavering support over the past months.\n\n\n\nPlaza Porticada\n\n\nSantander itself is a gem of a city and the capital of the picturesque Cantabria region, characterized by lush green mountains and a stunning coastline. It seamlessly blends three distinct elements: the urban landscape, the serene sea, and the majestic mountains. Upon arrival, I embarked on a walk along the coastline, where one side revealed the charming city with its exquisite early 20th-century architecture. On the other side of the bay, the azure sea stretched out, cradling Santander, while the verdant mountains framed the entire panorama. It was an awe-inspiring sight.\n\n\n\nSea and mountains\n\n\nCompared to Bilbao, Santander exudes a more laid-back atmosphere, leaning towards tourism rather than being solely business-oriented. This is partly due to its proximity to the sea, making it a coveted beach destination and a hub for aquatic sports enthusiasts.\n\n\n\nCentro Botin and the Santander bay\n\n\nDuring my stay, I had the opportunity to explore several fascinating museums. First on the list was the Centro Botin, a contemporary art museum housed in a stunning building designed by the renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, situated right by the sea. The highlight of the visit was the exhibition by American artist Roni Horn, which focused on water and rivers, an apt theme given the museum’s location. The Centro Botin also boasts an impressive collection of modern art, and the staff is exceptionally helpful, offering guided tours and insights into the various exhibitions. I highly recommend a visit.\n\n\n\nGlass sculptures by Roni Horn\n\n\nAnother must-see is the Cantabria Archaeological Museum, conveniently located in the city center next to the Mercado Municipal del Este, a former market converted into a small shopping area. Cantabria boasts a rich history, particularly in terms of ancient caves like Altamira, and this museum effectively portrays that heritage. Its well-curated exhibits provide valuable insights into local prehistory. If you have an interest in history, archaeology, and early civilizations, this museum is a must-visit.\nLastly, the Cantabrian Maritime Museum, set against the backdrop of the bay, offers a captivating collection that delves into the region’s seafaring history, fishing traditions, and its deep connection to the sea. The museum also features a beautiful aquarium on its lower level, showcasing local marine species in their natural habitats. This is a definite must-visit, especially if you’re traveling with children.\n\n\n\nView of the Playa de los Bikinis at Madalena Island\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Santander is renowned as a seaside resort, and the northern part of the city boasts beautiful beaches, perfect for leisurely strolls by the sea. I was fortunate to visit on a warm late spring day, allowing me to relish an enjoyable afternoon at the beach. The beaches at the Madalena island, facing the city, are particularly breathtaking. The city skyline, lush mountains, expansive sea, and golden sandy beaches together form a truly picturesque backdrop.\nSo, aside from my academic pursuits at the Universidad de Cantabria, I’m absolutely determined to return to Santander, this time with my children, to relish all the experiences and delights this captivating city has to offer.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {Four Days in {Santander}},\n  date = {2023-08-21},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230821_Santander},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “Four Days in Santander.”\nAugust 21, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230821_Santander."

    "text": "One of my goals while studying at a Spanish institution is to improve my Spanish. Portuguese and Spanish are mutually intelligible languages, so being Portuguese, it is relatively easy to learn the basics and get by. However, developing a level of mastery that allows for natural discourse is a completely different matter. Like with any other language, that takes time and effort. You need to be exposed to the language, read, and listen.\nAs part of my quest to read more in Spanish, during my stay in Spain in June, I browsed some bookstores for something to read. In one of these outings, I stumbled upon the book by the Spanish philosopher and pedagogue Gregorio Luri, titled ‘En busca del tiempo en que vivimos – Fragmentos del hombre moderno’ (which can be translated to ‘In search of the time we live in – fragments of the modern man’). Since I was in search of something to read and didn’t want to commit to more demanding literature at the time, the book, a philosophical essay on the modern world and its quirks, seemed like a nice compromise—relevant and approachable—so I decided to buy it.\n\n\n\nGregorio Luri’s latest book\n\n\nLike many in my age group in Portugal, I had two years of philosophy in high school and barely managed to pass. Maybe it was the way it was taught (although I actually have a positive memory of the teacher), maybe it was my own immaturity, or maybe it was an arrogant disdain by a teenager aspiring to study hard sciences—perhaps, it was all of them together. But at the time, I absolutely detested it. Over the past years, as I’ve developed a more mature view of the world, I’ve grown to enjoy reading philosophical works.\nGregorio Luri’s book is an interesting and relevant read. It explores some of the excesses and quirks of our modern society insightfully. From the aversion to progress and the deification of nature to the belief that we stand at the end of times while in a period of abundance, Luri’s book is a thought-provoking work on the inherent tensions of modern society, the struggle between the old and the new, and the limits of what it means to be human.\nThe book was published in early 2023, but while reading it, it becomes clear that it was partly written during the 2020/2021 COVID-19 crises. The excesses of the crises are present and shape the discourse, particularly in the way the elderly were simultaneously cared for and not cared for, reflecting on the criteria for the allocation of resources and the ever-changing narrative during this period.\nI was particularly struck by part one, where the author explores the current mistrust of science and progress while exposing the faith-based implicit trust in ‘nature’ and all that is natural. I believe that this is one of the most dangerous forms of the present ‘my ignorance is just as valid as your knowledge’ excesses of our social media-fueled society.\nIn an era shaped by dogmatic binary positioning, ’En busca del tiempo en que vivimos – Fragmentos del hombre moderno’ is a thought-provoking work that helps the reader take a more mature and distanced look at the excesses of society in a broader context. It was an interesting read that I strongly recommend. I am looking forward to reading more works (in Spanish) by Gregorio Luri.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {A {Review} of “{En} Busca Del Tiempo de Que Vivimos”},\n  date = {2023-08-28},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230828_En_busca_del_tiempo},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “A Review of ‘En Busca Del\nTiempo de Que Vivimos’.” August 28, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230828_En_busca_del_tiempo."

    "text": "I took the week of August fifteenth off. The fifteenth is a holiday in Portugal, the day of Our Lady of the Assumption, so I always take that week off to go to the beach with the children. I usually use this week to catch up on my reading. However, with three young children, those days of burning through three or four books in a week are long gone. Nevertheless, I can’t complain about this last short holiday because I was able to finish the Gregorio Luri book I mentioned in my previous post and more books. One of them was a short 120-page book, Anthony Weston’s “A Rulebook for Arguments”.\n\n\n\nA Rulebook for Arguments\n\n\nThis book had been recommended in my PhD class, “Argumentos y falacias: cómo construir y reconocer discursos racionales” (Arguments and Fallacies: How to Construct and Recognize Rational Discourses). It was one of the classes I attended last semester and quite enjoyed. It was a short course on how to craft and develop effective argumentation, which is useful for someone pursuing an academic career.\nThis is a short yet extremely well-organized book. It introduces fifty rules that skillfully guide the reader through the best practices of constructing an effective argument. The book is concise, direct, and exceptionally well-written. Its structured approach aids the reader in organizing the key principles of argumentation while avoiding common pitfalls, and the examples presented with each rule help make them clearer.\nIn an era marked by the prevalence of fake news and contentious online debates, this book serves as a valuable and potent guide. It benefits not only those seeking to craft compelling arguments but also individuals looking to adeptly filter through the fallacies. In our information-saturated age, where misinformation and misleading arguments proliferate, the ability to discern valid reasoning from fallacious claims is invaluable.\nI found Chapter VI particularly useful as it delves into deductive arguments. This skill is especially important for researchers who wish to communicate their results effectively and assertively. In the world of academia, where ideas are rigorously examined and debated, the ability to construct and present airtight arguments is a prized asset. Deductive reasoning, as explored in this chapter, offers researchers a powerful tool to build logical, well-structured, and persuasive arguments.\nFinally, the appendix lists and exposes the most common forms of fallacies. Fallacies are errors in reasoning that can make an argument invalid. As I mentioned before in today’s online world knowing how to identify and counter-argument fallacies is an important skill whose usefulness goes far beyond crafting effective arguments.\nI strongly recommend reading Anthony Weston’s “A Rulebook for arguments.” to anyone who wishes to improve their argumentative skills, particularly if you are doing research and want to be able to communicate your arguments in a structured and convincing manner.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{granja-correia2023,\n  author = {Granja-Correia, João},\n  title = {A {Review} of “{A} {Rulebook} for {Arguments}”},\n  date = {2023-09-04},\n  url = {https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230904_Rulebook_for_arguments},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGranja-Correia, João. 2023. “A Review of ‘A Rulebook for\nArguments’.” September 4, 2023. https://joao.granja-correia.eu/blog/blog_20230904_Rulebook_for_arguments."
