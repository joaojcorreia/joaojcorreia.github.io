    "section": "",
    "text": "Disclaimer: This blog post is created as an exercise for the “Writing your PhD thesis in humanities” course at Unican, with the aim of providing practical insights and tips on the thesis writing process in the humanities field. The information presented here is based on personal experiences and research, and should not be construed as professional advice or guidance.\nAs I write my first blog post I try to reflect on the questions that it should address for the present course task. Firstly, although I am attending a course on writing a PhD thesis, I do not intend to write a thesis per se, my goal is to develop an article based PhD. Hence my focus is more on acquiring an adequate writing style for publishing papers.\nAdditionally, I have a background in engineering and am pursuing the PhD in Management, which doesn’t fit exactly the definition of humanities. My different background, path and experiences will surely translate themselves in a different writing style. However, I chose none-the-less to enroll in this course because I believe that the points covered in here and the skills that I will be forced to develop, will none still prove useful in my specific context.\nMy work focus in the field of project management, where I wish to address the differences between agile and the traditional project management approaches, the later nowadays frequently referred to as predictive. My goal is to look at these differences through the lens of paradox theory. Intuitively I feel that their fundamental and defining difference lies in the way both approaches address the tension between the need to plan and the need to accept change and uncertainty.\nMy area of interest implies that a significant chunk of my audience will have a similar background to my own, i.e. engineering with some management training, or management with an relevant understanding of engineering. I would like to believe that this translates itself in an audience that has a practical and pragmatic approach to the text, in search of meaning and not elaborate metaphors and writing styles. This doesn’t imply that it should be a practical, applicational and descriptive text, quite the opposite it needs to have both theory and to present a definite contribution to theory.\nHence, I will strive to have a conversational yet precise style of writing. Perhaps using a semi-conversational form of academic English. Focusing on using short and clear phrases.\nHowever, I am not a native speaker, hence occasionally I feel I lack the mastery over English as a written language I would like to have. As a student I took the regular English classes at school, from the 5th grade to the 11th grade. However, being native of a country where movie and tv predominantly use under-titles I have had plenty of exposure to English as a spoken language. Additionally, my own idiosyncratic nerd-centric reading interests have ensured that at a relatively early age, I have had to abandon my native language books for predominantly English language editions. Having said that, and although I feel I have an adequate lever of English for the task-at-hand, I sometimes struggle with the language. Particularly grammar and the phonetic irregularities of the language.\nI would like to evolve my writing style to a style of prose like that of Bent Flyvbjerg. A Danish scholar that, not only has a significant number of publications in the field of project management, particular in megaprojects. But also, and perhaps with a greater significance, on social sciences as an area of study, and the methodological and philosophical ways of approaching them.\nFinally, and addressing the final point of this first task, when possible, I like to write first thing in the morning. And as frequently as feasible, considering my workload and other tasks that might take precedence. I tend to write and then go back and review. I am not a perfectionist, generally I strive for fit-for-purpose. And it is my understanding, supported by the opinions of many scholars that have gone through the same process, that this is a skill that can only be meaningfully developed with repetition. It is an activity that I genuinely enjoy, and that with time I hope to master."

    "text": "Disclaimer: This blog post is created as an exercise for the “Writing your PhD thesis in humanities” course at Unican, with the aim of providing practical insights and tips on the thesis writing process in the humanities field. The information presented here is based on personal experiences and research, and should not be construed as professional advice or guidance.\nCaveat: As I’ve mentioned on my previous post, I don’t intend to write a PhD thesis per se, but my objective is to write one based on articles. So, for the sake of this exercise, I will go over one of the articles that I am planning to write.\nTitle: Agile, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\nThis title is based on one of the most popular internet memes about agile. The meme captures the moment where, in the 1987 movie “The Princess Bride”, Iñigo Montoya (played by Mandy Patinkin) says to Vizzini (played by Wallace Shawn) “Inconceivable, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means”. Thus making the final pun to the recurrent joke of Vizzini’s abuse of the expression “Inconceivable”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo some extent the managers have out-mastered Vizzini in their own abuse ad nauseam of the word “Agile”. In the last couple of years agile has become something of a buzzword in the corporate world. Being seen as a panacea that will resolve all corporate ailments, sometimes far beyond the management of projects.\nPractitioners frequently complain that many of the procedures implemented under the guise of “agile”, have become opportunities for the institutionalization of micro-management and the complete eradication of any mid-term planning. Creating toxic work environments, where bad-practices are kept on track with the help of pseudo-scientific metrics like burn-charts. This usage of agile as wondered far beyond the principles set in the Agile Manifesto.\nIn this paper I intend to conduct a grounded theory study of how agile can be defined, and what makes it different from the predictive approach. In order to do this I will analyze their practices through the paradox theory lens. To do this, I must first develop a good understanding of paradox theory, and how it defines and classifies the several paradox management strategies. And then, in a systematic way, classify agile and predictive practices in this framework. At the end I hope to identify a pattern that allows for the definition of agile.\nSo, addressing point number two of the current task, I believe at the end the table of contents of the paper will look something like this:\n\nIntroduction\nAgile defined in contraposition to predictive\nParadox theory as a meaningful lens\nResearch question\nMethodology\nResults\nDiscussion\nConclusions\nImplications for practice\nLimitations\n\nAnswering point number three, although I intend to apply some agility in managing the effort and timings (pun intended), I believe that it will probably look something like this. However, please take note that some of these tasks will be simultaneous:\n\nIdeation and research – 3 months\nWriting points 1 to 4 – 6 months\nGrounded theory approach – 4 months\nWriting points 5 and 6 – 2 months\nWriting points 7 and 10 – 3 months\n\nPlease take note that I am inexperienced in these tasks, and hence, my effort estimation carries little weight."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As a project management researcher and a PhD candidate, I am always looking for new ways to understand the challenges and frustrations that project managers face in their daily work. One of the sources that I find fascinating and insightful is the internet memes that project managers create and share online. Memes are humorous images or videos that often reflect the cultural and social aspects of a group or a situation. They can also reveal the emotions and attitudes of the people who create or consume them.\nIn this blog post, I want to share some of the project management memes that I have collected over time and analyze what they tell us about the common problems and pain points that project managers encounter. Some of the recurring themes that I have noticed are: lack of prioritization, unrealistic expectations from management, insufficient resources and sprint plans gone wrong. Here are some examples of these memes:\n\n\n\nLack of prioritization\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealistic expectations from management\n\n\n\n\n\nInsufficient resources\n\n\n\n\n\nSprint planning gone wrong\n\n\nThese memes show how project managers use humour to cope with the stress and frustration that they experience in their work. My goal is to eventually build a comprehensive database of project management memes and use them as a data source for my research. I hope that by doing so, I can contribute to the advancement of project management knowledge and practice.\nDo you have any funny PM memes? email them to me."

    "title": "Tuber - connecting R to Youtube API",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my first post related to R. Currently, I am working on a project focused on analyzing the comments from a series of videos featuring “SúperBigote” from the Venezuelan National TV’s, on a parritular YouTube channel (at a later date I will delve on the nature and origin of this channel).\nSince these videos can be classified as political propaganda, my objective is to conduct sentiment analysis and explore the words and expressions associated with each video. To begin this analysis, my initial step would involve scraping all the comments and associated data, such as likes and comments on comments, for further examination.\nAfter some search online I found out the “tuber” package. The R package “tuber” is a powerful tool for accessing and analyzing YouTube data directly within the R programming environment. Developed to simplify the process of extracting information from YouTube’s extensive collection of videos, channels, and playlists, tuber provides a comprehensive set of functions and features. With tuber, users can effortlessly retrieve video metadata, including title, description, view count, and upload date, as well as gather detailed statistics on channels and playlists. Additionally, tuber offers functionalities for searching videos, accessing comments, and even downloading video content. Its intuitive and user-friendly design makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced data scientists, making it an essential package for anyone interested in leveraging YouTube data for research, analysis, or content creation purposes.\nDue to the necessity of integrating with the YouTube API and the challenges I faced in finding up-to-date, comprehensive instructions online, I have decided to create this post. In doing so, I aim to provide a step-by-step guide that addresses the difficulties I encountered, ensuring a smoother integration process for others who may be facing similar obstacles.\nSo the first step is installing the tuber package and loading the library:\n\ninstall.packages('tuber')\nlibrary(tuber)\n\nNext you will need to go the Google APIs dashboard and create a new project. I already had my Google APIs account active from a previous project, so there might be an extra step here if you haven’t one already.\n\nThen, enable APIs and Services. -&gt; search for YouTube Data API v3 and enable that one.\n\nNext, create credentials. -&gt; You need to choose OAuth Client ID.\n\nFor that you will need to first setup the consent screen. Afterwards create the OAuth Client ID. Here you need to chose the Web application.\n\n\nOnce the you done this, you have finished. Now you need to take note of the ClientID and the Secret, and to download the Json to your working directory.\n\nIn R you code should look like this:\n\nlibrary(tuber)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nid &lt;- '108XXXXXXXXX-myidAAAAAAAA.apps.googleusercontent.com'\nsecret &lt;- 'GOCSPX-wrMYSECRETXXXXXXXXXX'\nyt_oauth(id, secret, token = '')\n\nOnce you’ve run the yt_oauth() command, you will authenticate the application and R will download a “.httr-oauth” file, and then tuber you connected to youtube and you can use all its functions. Namely the get_all_comments() to download all comments. Which later you can place it in a data-frame, and do data wrangling as needed.\nFrom session to session you need to reauthenticate the application by running the yt_oauth(). If you already have the “.httr-oauth” file on your working directory, this wont work. So to get around this, I added this piece of code at the beginning of my script.\n\nif (file.exists('.httr-oauth')) {\n  file.remove('.httr-oauth')\n}\n\nThis post marks the beginning of a series where I will delve into the analysis process. A significant challenge I face is that the majority of comments are in Spanish, rendering standard sentiment analysis packages ineffective. Therefore, my next hurdle will involve exploring alternative solutions, such as finding a suitable sentiment analysis package or utilizing a machine learning model capable of classifying the vast number of comments. Alternatively, I might resort to manually classifying approximately 6000 comments. Regardless, this presents an intriguing challenge that I am prepared to tackle in the upcoming stages."

    "title": "Reflections on Bent Flyvbjerg’s ‘Making Social Science Matter’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the realm of social science inquiry, navigating the complexities of research can often feel like a daunting task. As someone pursuing a PhD in management with an engineering background, I have personally experienced the struggle of reconciling my hard-science approach with the intricacies of social phenomena. Bent Flyvbjerg has focused much of his research in the field of project management. This was my initial contact with his work, namely his very relevant “Top Ten Behavioral Biases in Project Management: An Overview”. However after devouring a few other articles of his I searched online for other publications. It was in this context that I stumbled upon Bent Flyvbjerg’s thought-provoking book, “Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How it Can Succeed Again.”.\nFlyvbjerg’s book struck a chord with me, as it directly addressed many of the internal struggles I have encountered when studying project management from a social science perspective. Coming from a hard-science background, I found myself grappling with the unique complexities inherent in social science research. Flyvbjerg’s insightful exploration shed light on these challenges and provided a fresh perspective.\nEarly on one aspect of the book that particularly captivated me was Flyvbjerg’s discussion of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. What made it even more intriguing was his clever analogy using the game of chess. As a parent, I have observed my seven-year-old son’s journey into the world of chess. While I possess a basic understanding of the rules and some theoretical openings knowledge, I have remained at the novice level, and after just a few months I started losing consistently to my son. Clearly he had developed context dependent knowledge, that he is unable to express beyond my own level. Flyvbjerg’s analysis shed light on the reasons behind this disparity, deepening my understanding of the complexities involved in mastering a skill.\nOne of the pivotal concepts that Flyvbjerg emphasizes is the distinction between phronesis, episteme, and téchne. Phronesis refers to practical wisdom and judgement, episteme relates to theoretical knowledge, and téchne denotes technical know-how. In the social sciences, context-dependent phronesis plays a crucial role. Flyvbjerg argues that understanding the social world requires more than just theoretical knowledge or technical skills; it necessitates the cultivation of practical wisdom in the given context. This resonated deeply with my own research journey, highlighting the significance of context in unraveling the complexities of the dynamics surrounding project management.\nFlyvbjerg’s exploration of reflexivity further enriched my understanding of the social sciences. Reflexivity calls for researchers to critically reflect on their own biases, values, and assumptions that may influence their inquiries. It serves as a vital tool for enhancing the rigor and validity of social science research. Flyvbjerg’s insights reinforced the importance of self-awareness and continuous introspection in my own work, allowing for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Through this book, I have gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors as a social science researcher, reminding me of the critical importance of context, practical wisdom, and self-reflection. I am looking forward to reading his more project management related book “How big things get done”."

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to Spain to attend classes at the Universidad de Cantabria in Santander. During my trip, I made sure to explore both Bilbao and Santander, and I’m thrilled to share my first blog post about the remarkable city of Bilbao, which I must say, it exceeded all expectations. From stunning architectural wonders to captivating museums, Bilbao offers a perfect blend of art, culture, and history.\n\n\n\nView from the Bilbao Museum\n\n\nBilbao is a captivating city that effortlessly combines modernity with a deep sense of cleanliness and orderliness. During my visit, I was astounded by the immaculate condition of the public spaces, which were meticulously maintained and adorned with beautiful flowering plants. It was refreshing to witness how everyone took great care in keeping the city clean, even those accompanied by their furry companions. The cityscape itself is a harmonious blend of charming pre-Civil War buildings and contemporary structures. The architectural design is well-planned, ensuring a seamless integration of old and new. The wide and spacious roads allow for smooth navigation, contributing to a sense of openness and accessibility.\n\n\n\nPublic gardens\n\n\nWhat struck me the most were the abundance of modern playgrounds scattered throughout the city, a testament to Bilbao’s dedication to creating a livable environment for its residents. Additionally, the availability of university-wide WiFi coverage was a pleasant surprise. It was remarkable to experience such widespread connectivity, enabling easy access to the internet for students and visitors alike.\n\n\n\nOld city - Casco viejo\n\n\nThe old city, known as “casco viejo,” is a charming and enchanting neighborhood that exudes historical allure. As I strolled through its narrow streets, I couldn’t help but be captivated by the well-preserved medieval buildings that lined the thoroughfares. The casco viejo is a bustling hub of commerce, with a myriad of shops catering to tourists and locals alike. It’s the perfect place to immerse yourself in the local culture and indulge in the renowned pintxos, the Basque Country’s version of tapas. The architectural beauty of the buildings, constructed from local stone, creates a mesmerizing interplay of light and colors in the vibrant squares.\nThe Ria, a river that gracefully winds through Bilbao, offers a picturesque setting for a leisurely stroll, allowing visitors to soak in the beauty of the city. As I wandered along its banks, I couldn’t help but appreciate the historical significance of the Ria in shaping Bilbao’s identity as a vital urban center. It served as a crucial and strategic waterway, contributing to the city’s growth and prominence over the years. The Ria is adorned with several noteworthy bridges that add to its charm. One of the highlights is the modern Zubizuri bridge, a pedestrian bridge with its distinctive white arch that gracefully spans the river, inviting pedestrians to cross with elegance. Another notable bridge is the Puente de La Salve, an architectural marvel that impressively connects both sides of the river.\n\n\n\nView if the Ría with the Guggenheim, Puente de La Salve and the Iberdrola tower\n\n\nMuseums to visit:\n\nFirst on the list is the Bilbao Museum, conveniently located near the iconic Iberdrola tower. This hidden gem houses a remarkable eclectic collection of art from the late 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The best part? Admission is free, making it an absolute must-visit.\nNo visit to Bilbao would be complete without a stop at the world-renowned Guggenheim Museum. Its distinctive architecture alone is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from far away. I highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance and arriving early. During my visit, I had the pleasure of exploring the Oskar Kokoschka exhibit. The visually impressive paintings were not only a feast for the eyes but also shed light on the tumultuous history of 20th-century Europe. The carefully curated exhibition allowed me to delve deeper into the artist’s journey and gain a profound understanding of the era in which he lived.\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the Bilbao Archeology Museum is an absolute must. Tucked away in the charming old city, this museum may go unnoticed by many. However, it holds a treasure trove of artifacts that shed light on Bilbao’s rich past. The stone age collection, in particular, showcases the importance of cave findings in the Bizkaia area. Through interactive displays, I embarked on a virtual journey to local caves, immersing myself in cave paintings. The museum’s antiquity and medieval collections further enhanced my understanding of Bilbao’s strategic significance throughout history.\n\nIn my next post, I will share my day trip to Portugalete. Situated just a short distance from Bilbao, this charming town offers a unique blend of historical landmarks and captivating coastal views."

    "title": "Day trip to Portugalete",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Following up on my previous adventures in Bilbao, I wanted to share the highlights of my day trip to Portugalete. On our last day in Bilbao, we decided to embark on a boat trip to explore this neighboring town. Opting for the El Bote Tours service turned out to be a fantastic choice as it provided us with an excellent experience from start to finish. I highly recommend this excursion to anyone visiting Bilbao!\n\n\n\nView from the Ria of the Bilbao museum, with children enjoying the summer day\n\n\nThe boat journey, lasting approximately an hour and a half, took us from the picturesque Bilbao ria all the way to the sea. As we gradually moved away from the bustling city, an intriguing transformation unfolded before our eyes. The remnants of Bilbao’s industrial past emerged on the horizon, with sprawling abandoned industrial spaces that served as a poignant reminder of the city’s history. However, what captured our attention was the sight of modern neighborhoods taking their place, breathing new life into the landscape. It was a fascinating contrast to witness the blend of Bilbao’s industrial heritage and the vibrant evolution of its urban fabric.\n\n\n\nModern residential buildings on the right bank, and old industrial building on the left bank\n\n\nAmidst the evolving landscape, Bilbao proudly preserves the occasional operating industrial buildings that stand as a testament to its rich industrial heritage. One remarkable example that encapsulates the city’s industrial prowess is the ArcelorMittal steel mill. Originally established as Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in the early 20th century, this steel production facility has been an integral part of Bilbao’s industrial development. Today, it continues to make a significant impact, providing employment opportunities for a large workforce and contributing to the local economy. The ArcelorMittal steel mill stands as a powerful reminder of Bilbao’s industrial legacy and the resilience of its industrial sector in the face of changing times.\n\n\n\nArcelorMittal steel mill\n\n\nThe boat tour concluded at the picturesque seaside village of Getxo, which added a touch of coastal charm to our Bilbao adventure. As we approached Getxo by sea, our gaze was captivated by the breathtaking Arriluce lighthouse, standing proudly as a welcoming beacon. Once a favored summer getaway for Bilbao’s affluent residents, Getxo still retains its elegant allure. The village is dotted with beautiful mansions, predominantly built in the early 20th century by the esteemed architect Manuel Maria Smith. These architectural gems, nestled among the village streets, offer a glimpse into a bygone era of opulence and refined aesthetics. Exploring Getxo is like stepping back in time, where the tranquility of the seaside blends harmoniously with the architectural splendor of these historic mansions.\n\n\n\nFaro de Arriluce\n\n\nBetween Getxo and Portugalete lies the magnificent Vizcaya Bridge, a remarkable engineering marvel that adds a touch of grandeur to the landscape. Built in 1893, this iconic iron construction stands as the world’s oldest transporter bridge. Designed by Alberto Palacio, a disciple of the renowned Gustave Eiffel, the bridge holds a special place in architectural history. During our visit, we had the pleasure of purchasing tickets and experiencing the thrill of moving across in the gondola. It was truly a unique and memorable journey. Adding to its prestige, the Vizcaya Bridge was rightfully recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on July 13, 2006. Still fully operational, the bridge spans 164 meters and operates every 8 minutes, seamlessly transporting both cars and passengers throughout the day.\n\n\n\nView of the Vyzcaya Bridge from Portugalete\n\n\nNestled by the tranquil Ria, Portugalete is a charming village that offers a serene cityscape. While wandering through its streets, we couldn’t help but admire two notable landmarks. The Estación de la Canilla, with its vibrant colors, stood gracefully by the water’s edge, enhancing the scenic beauty of the surroundings. The imposing Basílica de Santa María commanded attention with its historical significance and architectural splendor. As the day drew to a close, we found solace in the convenience of the modern subway connection, making our journey back to the city seamless.\n\n\n\nView of Portugalete with the Basílica de Santa María and the Estación de la Canilla\n\n\nComing up next on my blog, I’ll be sharing my experiences and adventures in the beautiful city of Santander."

The architectural beauty of the buildings, constructed from local stone, creates a mesmerizing interplay of light and colors in the vibrant squares.\nThe Ria, a river that gracefully winds through Bilbao, offers a picturesque setting for a leisurely stroll, allowing visitors to soak in the beauty of the city. As I wandered along its banks, I couldn’t help but appreciate the historical significance of the Ria in shaping Bilbao’s identity as a vital urban center. It served as a crucial and strategic waterway, contributing to the city’s growth and prominence over the years. The Ria is adorned with several noteworthy bridges that add to its charm. One of the highlights is the modern Zubizuri bridge, a pedestrian bridge with its distinctive white arch that gracefully spans the river, inviting pedestrians to cross with elegance. Another notable bridge is the Puente de La Salve, an architectural marvel that impressively connects both sides of the river.\n\n\n\nView if the Ría with the Guggenheim, Puente de La Salve and the Iberdrola tower\n\n\nMuseums to visit:\n\nFirst on the list is the Bilbao Museum, conveniently located near the iconic Iberdrola tower. This hidden gem houses a remarkable eclectic collection of art from the late 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The best part? Admission is free, making it an absolute must-visit.\nNo visit to Bilbao would be complete without a stop at the world-renowned Guggenheim Museum. Its distinctive architecture alone is a sight to behold, drawing visitors from far away. I highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance and arriving early. During my visit, I had the pleasure of exploring the Oskar Kokoschka exhibit. The visually impressive paintings were not only a feast for the eyes but also shed light on the tumultuous history of 20th-century Europe. The carefully curated exhibition allowed me to delve deeper into the artist’s journey and gain a profound understanding of the era in which he lived.\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the Bilbao Archeology Museum is an absolute must. Tucked away in the charming old city, this museum may go unnoticed by many. However, it holds a treasure trove of artifacts that shed light on Bilbao’s rich past. The stone age collection, in particular, showcases the importance of cave findings in the Bizkaia area. Through interactive displays, I embarked on a virtual journey to local caves, immersing myself in cave paintings. The museum’s antiquity and medieval collections further enhanced my understanding of Bilbao’s strategic significance throughout history.\n\nIn my next post, I will share my day trip to Portogalete. Situated just a short distance from Bilbao, this charming town offers a unique blend of historical landmarks and captivating coastal views."
