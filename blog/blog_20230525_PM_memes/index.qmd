As a project management researcher and a PhD candidate, I am always looking for new ways to understand the challenges and frustrations that project managers face in their daily work. One of the sources that I find fascinating and insightful is the internet memes that project managers create and share online. Memes are humorous images or videos that often reflect the cultural and social aspects of a group or a situation. They can also reveal the emotions and attitudes of the people who create or consume them.

In this blog post, I want to share some of the project management memes that I have collected over time and analyze what they tell us about the common problems and pain points that project managers encounter. Some of the recurring themes that I have noticed are: lack of prioritization, unrealistic expectations from management, insufficient resources and sprint plans gone wrong. Here are some examples of these memes:

These memes show how project managers use humour to cope with the stress and frustration that they experience in their work. My goal is to eventually build a comprehensive database of project management memes and use them as a data source for my research. I hope that by doing so, I can contribute to the advancement of project management knowledge and practice.
